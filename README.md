# ELIZA
School project #2 using an Eliza bot
there are two files promptBank and Eliza without one of the files the other file will not work they both have to be used in the same main file.

What it does: when the program starts the user will be asked by the bot to input their name, once the name is inputted the bot will then ask another question for the user to answer, then the program will take the first and last word from the inputted sentence and ask a random question with the two words taken from the previous sentence.
